# Chance Constrained K-CBS
Chance Constrained Kinodynamic-CBS (CCK-CBS) is a decoupled motion planning algorithm capable of solving complex multi-agent motion planning queries for robots with uncertain dynamics due to process and/or measurement noise. For details on the inner workings of the algorithm, please see our [2023 IEEE RAL Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10333309).

# Note
This repository is the working implementation of CCK-CBS that requires ([The Open Motion Planning Library](https://github.com/ompl/ompl)) (OMPL) to run. If you are interested in the traditional K-CBS implementation from our [2022 IEEE IROS Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9982018), then please proceed to [the new repository](https://github.com/aria-systems-group/Multi-Robot-OMPL). Thank you for your cooperation and please feel free to open an issue if you have any questions.
