# K-CBS
Kinodynamic-CBS (K-CBS) is a decentralized motion planning algorithm capable of solving complex multi-agent motion planning queries for agent with complex, possibly unique, kinodynamic constraints. 

# Note
This repository is the working implementation of K-CBS that requires ([The Open Motion Planning Library](https://github.com/ompl/ompl)) (OMPL) to run. However, it is incomplete after a huge code refactor from our IROS 2023 submission. We will not be updating this repository unless otherwise requested through an "Issue". 

 The reason for this dramatic change is because our efforts have refocused to integrating this algorithm directly with OMPL so that K-CBS will (hopefully) be included with future releases of OMPL. Therefore, we have moved repositories to avoid conflicts (pun inteneded) with any old papers. Please see [the new repository](https://github.com/aria-systems-group/Kinodynamic-Conflict-Based-Search) for updated code, bug fixes, etc. Thank you for your cooperation.
